Custom options for this map:
-   Map Ratio - Choose the map ratio that you prefer. From proportionally squared for compact expansion, to wide rectangular map for far away expansion.
-   Size Modifier - Alter the map size result by applying a size modifier to it.
-   Sea Level - With Tectonic, Sea Level changes the height of the water rather than the amount of ocean.
-   Rift Width - Adjust the width of ocean rifts between plates and impassable rift at the easternmost and westernmost edge of the map.
-   Arctic Ocean Width - Adjust the width of arctic ocean rifts at the northernmost and southernmost edge of the map.
-   Islands - Adjust the amount of occurrence for islands generation.
-   Plate Motion - Alters the prominence of mountain belts and rifts. Faster plate motion means higher mountain ranges and deeper ocean rifts.
-   Continents - Affects the shape of the continental land masses to have lakes and inlets.
-   Land - Changes the amount of land on the map by altering the number of oceanic plates.
-   Plates - Affects the number of tectonic plates that will be used in map generation. More plates will result in smaller land masses and more intricate structures.
-   Force Coastal Start - Force every civilization to start on coast.
-   Start Placement - Choose the regional division method that affects start placement for major civilizations and how AI will behave to the map.
