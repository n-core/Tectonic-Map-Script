Additional modification made by N.Core.
Custom options for this map:
-   Size Modifier
    Alter the map slightly by applying a size modifier to it.
-   Sea Level
    With Tectonic, Sea Level changes the height of the water rather than the amount of ocean.
-   Ocean Rift Width
    Adjust the width of ocean rifts and impassable rift at the edge of the map.
-   Plate Motion
    Alters the prominence of mountain belts and rifts. Faster plate motion means higher mountain ranges and deeper ocean rifts.
-   Continents
    Affects the shape of the continental land masses to have lakes and inlets.
-   Land
    Changes the amount of land on the map by altering the number of oceanic plates.
-   Plates
    Affects the number of tectonic plates that will be used in map generation. More plates will result in smaller land masses and more intricate structures.
