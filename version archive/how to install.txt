Additional modification made by N.Core.

Custom options for this map:
-   Size Modifier - Alter the map slightly by applying a size modifier to it.
-   Sea Level - With Tectonic, Sea Level changes the height of the water rather than the amount of ocean.
-   Ocean Rift Width - Adjust the width of ocean rifts and impassable rift at the edge of the map.
-   Plate Motion - Alters the prominence of mountain belts and rifts. Faster plate motion means higher mountain ranges and deeper ocean rifts.
-   Continents - Affects the shape of the continental land masses to have lakes and inlets.
-   Land - Changes the amount of land on the map by altering the number of oceanic plates.
-   Plates - Affects the number of tectonic plates that will be used in map generation. More plates will result in smaller land masses and more intricate structures.
